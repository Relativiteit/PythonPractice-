This repository contains code I am writing while doing the course introduction to python at the VU Amsterdam

## Part 1. Module 1 Editing,Compiling and Executing

### 1. Print statements 

- `hello_world.py` a script printing Hello world.
- `hello_world2.py` a script added personal information for grading.

## Part 2. Module 2 If statements and loops

### 2. Efficient programming and constants 

- `vat.py` a Python code snippet used to calculate the VAT of a article
- `plumber.py` a Python code snippet calculating billable hours total cost and adding call-out costs.
- `othello_1` a Python code snippet taking in account scoring for the game othello.
### 3. If-statements and identifiers

- `electronics_battered.py`a Python code snippit take the price of three products as input and print the discount on most expensive product and final price as ouput.
- `othello_2` a Python code snippet determining the time in hh:mm:ss of the actions of eacht player and determining the human player. 

### 4. lists and insertion sort algorithm

- `alphabet.py` a Python code snippet printing the alphabet using only "ord" and "chr" functions. 
- `collatz.py` a Python code snippet collatz conjecture.  
- `second_smallest.py` a Python code snippet using insertion sort algorithm.
