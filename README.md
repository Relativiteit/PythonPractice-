This repository contains code I am writing while doing the course introduction to python at the VU Amsterdam

## Part 1. Module 1 Introduction

### 1. Print statements 

- `hello_world.py` a script printing Hello world.
- `hello_world2.py` a script added personal information for grading.

## Part 2. Module 2 Control flow 

### 2. Module 2 

- `listcomps.py` a Python code snippet used to visualise list comprehension in Python.
- `gen_exps.py` a Python code snippet showing how to use generator expressions.
- `tuples_lists.py` a Python code snippet demonstrating the uses of tuples and lists in Python.
- `arrays_queues.py` a Python code snippet demonstrating when to use arrays and queues, and why in Python.

### 3. Dictionaries and Sets
